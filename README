This is the initial release and still needs lots of work. It uses a WiFly module for communication to the phone. It joins the WiFly to a local wireless network, this will probably be changed to the WiFly setting up an adhoc network for the phone to connect to a known ip after joining it. That is assuming that a WiFly is still used in the future. The best communication path is probably with Bluetooth 4 BLE but that requires a BLE enabled phone so for now that limits the phones available to use.

Configuration
The current version joins the WiFly to a local wireless network to talk to the phone. To do this you need to hardcode the SSID and Passcode. It currently supports 2 different SSIDs and will failover to the second one if it can't join the first. Set MY_WIFI_SSID and MY_WIFI_PASSPHRASE at least.
